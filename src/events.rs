//! Notifications that are emitted when significant things happen in the local HotStuff-rs replica.
//! 
//! ## Event enum
//! 
//! Significant occurences in the replica include committing a block, starting a new view, broadcasting
//! a proposal, or receiving a proposal.
//! 
//! Each of these significant occurences correspond to a variant of the [event enum](Event). Each variant
//! tuple in turn contains an inner struct type. For example, the [insert block variant](Event::InsertBlock)
//! contains the [InsertBlockEvent] struct type.
//! 
//! Each inner struct stores information that summarizes the particular kind of event. This information always
//! includes a timestamp corresponding to the exact time when the event occured.
//! 
//! ## Registering event handlers
//! 
//! Library users can register event handler closures, which are then internally called by the library's 
//! [event bus](crate::event_bus::start_event_bus) thread when the handler's particular event variant  happens. 
//! 
//! Custom event handlers can be registered using the [replica builder pattern](crate::replica), while default event
//! handlers that log out events (e.g., into the terminal, or into a log file) can be enabled in the
//! [configuration](crate::replica::Configuration).
//! 
//! ## Timing
//! 
//! Events are always emitted **after** the corresponding occurence is "completed". So for example, the
//! [insert block event](InsertBlockEvent) is only emitted after the insertion has been persisted into the backing
//! storage of the block tree.
