# GitHub Actions Workflow that generates Rustdocs for HotStuff-rs every time a commit is pushed to a 
# branch or a stable release or pre-release is released, and then pushes this Rustdocs to the master
# branch of the [hotstuff_rs_docs](https://github.com/parallelchain-io/hotstuff_rs_docs) repository so
# that it may automatically be deployed to GitHub Pages.
#
# The jobs and steps in this workflow are quite straightforward, and the high-level flow should be
# understandable just by reading the `name` keys of each step in turn. Additional context and 
# explanation is provided by the comments in the YAML.

        # To illustrate the necessity of sanitization, consider what could happen if we **do not** sanitize
        # the refname "dev/v0.4". In this case, the folder structure will contain the following subtree:
        # - dev/
        #   - v0.4/
        #       - Rustdocs for "dev/v0.4"
        # 
        # If, in this scenario, someone pushes a commit to a branch called "dev", the "Prepare the subfolder"
        # step will clear the entirity of "dev/" before placing the Rustdocs for "dev" under it, resulting in
        # the following, undesired folder structure:
        # - dev/
        #    - Rustdocs for "dev/"
        #    - (The Rustdocs for "dev/v0.4" have been accidentally deleted!)
        #
        # The sanitization step below ensures that the folder structure in the scenario becomes the following
        # instead:
        # - dev/
        #     - Rustdocs for "dev/"
        # - dev/%2Fv0.4
